# vbmapdata

This app is a project of Code for America <:us:/> and [Code for Hampton Roads](https://github.com/code4HR/), specifically for the Hampton Roads Area of Virginia.

Our goal is to build a web based tool that takes a count of any item by neighborhood for a given list of neighborhoods and outputs a colored map of neighborhoods by count, so that we can chart statistics by neighborhood. The desire is to be generic enough to support any HRVA city, but not too generic - should assume users are concerned specifically with HRVA cities.
* Example: EMS Calls by Neighborhood in Virginia Beach
